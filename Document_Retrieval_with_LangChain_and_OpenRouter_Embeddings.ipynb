Overview**  \\nLangSmith is an observability platform designed for LLM applications, integrating effortlessly with LangChain (an open-source framework for building LLM-powered apps) and LangGraph (for creating stateful, workflow-based apps). This integration requires no additional code, enabling developers to gain insights effortlessly.\\n\\n**2. Why Observability Matters in LLMs**  \\nLLMs are non-deterministic—they can generate unpredictable outputs, making debugging complex. Observability tools like LangSmith provide transparency into how inputs are processed, helping identify failures, inefficiencies, or unexpected behaviors.\\n\\n**3. Integration without Instrumentation**  \\n- **Automatic Tracing**: Once configured, LangSmith automatically captures traces of LLM calls, chains, and workflows, including inputs, outputs, errors, and intermediate steps.  \\n- **Compatibility**: Works natively with LangChain (e.g., chains, agents) and LangGraph (stateful workflows), requiring only basic setup.\\n\\n**4. Quick Setup Guide**  \\n1. **Installation**: Add `langsmith` via pip:  \\n   ```bash\\n   pip install langsmith\\n   ```\\n2. **API Configuration**: Set environment variables for your LangSmith API key and project:  \\n   ```python\\n   import os\\n   os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"\\n   os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"] = \"ls_...\"  # Your LangSmith API key\\n   ```\\n3. **Start Logging**: Existing LangChain/LangGraph code will now auto-log traces to LangSmith. No code changes needed!\\n\\n**5. Observability Across Development Stages**  \\n- **Prototyping**: Debug prompts, inspect intermediate outputs (e.g., retrieved documents in RAG), and optimize prompts/parameters.  \\n- **Beta Testing**: Track latency, token usage, and user feedback to identify edge cases.  \\n- **Production**: Monitor costs, performance trends, and error rates, setting alerts for anomalies.\\n\\n**6. Key Features & Benefits**  \\n- **Detailed Traces**: Visualize every step of complex chains or workflows in the LangSmith UI (see example below).  \\n  ![LangSmith Trace Example](https://example.com/trace-screenshot) *(Hypothetical example: A trace showing an agent\\'s tool usage and LLM call sequence)*  \\n- **Metrics Dashboard**: Analyze aggregate data (latency, cost per call, error rates).  \\n- **Collaboration**: Share traces with teams to debug jointly or review user sessions.  \\n- **Custom Feedback**: Add user ratings or tags to traces for iterative improvement.  \\n\\n**7. Use Cases**  \\n- **Debugging a Chain**: Identify why a LangChain agent returns irrelevant results by inspecting its tool inputs/outputs.  \\n- **Cost Optimization**: Track token usage across models to choose cost-effective options.  \\n- **Prompt Engineering**: Compare outputs of different prompts in the UI to refine phrasing.  \\n\\n**8. Resources**  \\n- [LangSmith + LangChain Setup Guide](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/langchain-setup)  \\n- [LangSmith + LangGraph Setup Guide](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/langgraph-setup)  \\n\\n**Conclusion**  \\nLangSmith eliminates the guesswork in managing LLM applications by providing LLM-native observability. Its seamless integration with LangChain and LangGraph empowers teams to build, debug, and scale applications with confidence, leveraging tailored insights across the entire development lifecycle. Whether optimizing prompts or ensuring production reliability, LangSmith turns observability into a strategic advantage.', 'refusal': None}}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 171, 'completion_tokens': 1413, 'total_tokens': 1584}}\n",

Here\\'s how to leverage each feature effectively:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **1. Embed: Tracing & Dashboards**\\n**Purpose:** Monitor your application\\'s performance in real-time and identify bottlenecks.  \\n**Steps to Implement:**  \\n- **Add Tracing:** Integrate LangSmith’s SDK into your codebase to automatically track LLM calls, latency, and errors.  \\n  ```python\\n  from langsmith import traceable\\n\\n  @traceable  # Decorator to trace a function\\n  def generate_response(prompt):\\n      # Your LLM interaction logic here\\n      return response\\n  ```\\n- **Create Dashboards:**  \\n  - Visualize metrics like **Requests Per Second (RPS)**, **error rates**, and **API costs**.\\n  - Filter by timeframes (e.g., last 24 hours) or endpoints to debug specific issues.\\n  - Example: Spot a spike in errors during peak traffic and trace it to a rate-limited API.\\n\\n**Use Case:** Fix latency issues by identifying slow LLM calls in your dashboard and optimizing queries.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **2. Evals: Evaluate Your AI’s Performance**\\n**Purpose:** Test your app’s outputs against benchmarks to ensure quality.  \\n**Steps to Implement:**  \\n1. **Create Evaluation Datasets:**  \\n   - Upload labeled test data (e.g., 100 prompt-response pairs) in the LangSmith UI.  \\n2. **Run Off-the-Shelf Evaluators:**  \\n   - Use built-in metrics like correctness, relevance, or safety (Python only).  \\n   ```python\\n   from langsmith.evaluation import evaluate_accuracy\\n\\n   results = evaluate_accuracy(dataset_name=\"my_test_set\")\\n   ```  \\n3. **Analyze Results:** Compare performance over time (e.g., response accuracy before/after a model update).  \\n4. **Collect Human Feedback:** Flag ambiguous outputs in the UI for team review.  \\n\\n**Use Case:** Catch regressions by running nightly evaluations after deploying a new prompt version.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **3. Prompt Engineering: Optimize Instructions for LLMs**\\n**Purpose:** Iterate on prompts to improve output quality and reliability.  \\n**Tools & Workflow:**  \\n- **A/B Testing:** Compare two prompts (e.g., `prompt_v1` vs `prompt_v2`) on the same dataset.  \\n- **Version Control:** Save prompt iterations and track which performs best in evaluations.  \\n- **Prompt Templates:** Dynamically adjust prompts based on user context.  \\n  ```python\\n  from langsmith.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\\n\\n  template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\\n      (\"system\", \"You are a {} assistant. Respond concisely.\"),\\n      (\"user\", \"{input}\")\\n  ])\\n  prompt = template.format(role=\"technical\", input=\"Explain quantum computing.\")\\n  ```\\n\\n**Use Case:** Refine a customer support prompt to reduce verbose responses by 40% through iterative testing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **How They Work Together**  \\n1. Use **Embed** to find issues (e.g., high latency).  \\n2. Test solutions with **Evals** to ensure fixes don’t break existing functionality.  \\n3. Apply **Prompt Engineering** to optimize outcomes, and repeat.  \\n\\nBy combining tracing, evaluations, and prompt iteration, LangSmith streamlines building robust, high-performing AI apps.

            "Observability is important for any software application, but especially so for LLM applications. LLMs are non-deterministic by nature, meaning they can produce unexpected results. This makes them trickier than normal to debug.\n",
            "This is where LangSmith can help! LangSmith has LLM-native observability, allowing you to get meaningful insights from your application. LangSmith‚Äôs observability features have you covered throughout all stages of application development - from prototyping, to beta testing, to production.\n",
